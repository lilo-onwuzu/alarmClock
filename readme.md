#### _Description_
	This site prompt the user for details to send in a email, formulates the email and displays it. 
	It is built with a html & js.
	An email object (construct) with fields for sender, receiver and message is created from an input form.
	A method (prototype) for the email construct is used to create the message to be sent.
	All js code is built in a modular form for simplicity during development
	We will need some dependendencies - programs that will concatenate all out js code and package it into one file
	A tool, Node Package Manager(npm) will help us install these dependencies into a new node_modules folder (ignored in git)
	Another tool Gulp will help us automate these tasks (concatenating, minifying etc) 
	Gulp will perform these tasks depending on the mode (development or production)
	The final js script will be save it in a new 'build' folder in a file 'app.js' (ignored in git) that is linked in our index.html file
